                    <p>
                        This is one of the first attempts to apply image captioning to traffic scene understanding. Due to the lack of public data, manual annotations were carried out of necessity. Although quite detailed in describing the models employed, indication of annotation
                        methods was sparse with only the provision of sample annotations. This would help to address the lack of open sourced data as well as

                    </p> -->
                    <h3>Handling for Cases of Occlusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Although not explicitly specified, it is heavily implied that the proposed approach utilizes a regular camera for signal ingestion; however, typical camera's do not have the benefits of FIR Camera's to deal with reduced light environments. More work needs
                        to be carried out to handle for multimodal data.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Consideration of Variations of CNN-RNN</h3>
                    <p>
                        Smaller networks such as MobileNetV1 as well as EfficientNet can be considered for the CNN. For the RNN portion, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers can be explored as well as LSTMs with Attention; however, care should be taken when using LSTMs with Attention
                        since they utilize a memory-hungry architecture known as a transformer.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Toward's a Gold-Standard for NLP Benchmarking</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is evident that there are disagreements with the existing NLP/MT benchmarking methods; thus, it is clear that there exists more work to be done when attempting to define a subsitute -- a proxy for human evaluation. For now, BLEU remains the supposed
                        gold-standard when working in the NLP/MT space; however, there exist other forms of benchmarks. Future work should include such benchmarks to assess their validity in serving as a proxy of what can be universally accepeted as human
                        evaluation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Integration of Detected Lane Lines</h3>
                    <p>
                        The lines of the lane provide information particular to a given moment within the scene that may be valuable to making sense of a series of scenes. Of course, this is likely to be challenging when dealing with inner-city high-traffic situations where
                        in which there are multiple objects within a scene ocluding the lane lines. Additional sensors can be considered, but would further exarcerbate the issue for in need of a sensor fusion solution. In addition, with more data comes
                        the need for more processing thus creating a necessity for more powerful compact hardware. More work needs to be done here in evaluating the value of adding an additional feature such as lane lines to this system in terms of image
                        captioning as well as what market is fit for such a tool.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Repurposing as a Driver's Perspectice Analysis Tool</h3>
                    <p>
                        Although initially proposed as a driving assistant, it is clear that the utility provided by such an assistant in reducing car accidents is limited. Further development and integration with vehicle would be necessary to integrate with control systems
                        such as auto braking. Distracted driving is a major leading cause of accidents and with such a tool, it makes me wonder to what extent would such a proposed assistant actually provide utility and to what extent would it distract
                        drivers in transit. The current system does not account for driver attention Further considerations from reflecting and research have lead me to believe
